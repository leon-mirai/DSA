"""
 In a hospital emergency room, patients are generally treated in the order they arrive. However, patients come in with varying degrees of 
    severity. Patients with critical conditions (urgent) must be treated before those with less severe conditions (regular). 
    You need to design a system that always processes patients with higher severity first. Which data structure should you use?



This requires a queue data structure to manage because the most urgent patietns are treated first
