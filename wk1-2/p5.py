"""
Arrays:
- random access
- can access elements easily
- good for small sets of data
- easy to use
- in/del is O(n)

Linked Lists:
- Pointer
- Good for large sets of data like a large list of names
- Or for polynomials
- Is great for deletion and insertion in middle O(1)
- Can insert things inbetween stuff
- Uses nodes


Linked list is better for frequent insert/deletion because arrays are O(n) due to frequent element shifting
